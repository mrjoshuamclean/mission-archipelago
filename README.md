# Mission Archipelago
Multiworld yaml generator for [Archipelago](www.archipelago.gg) asyncs run by
[Retro Indie Josh](retroindiejosh.itch.io). Props to [Async
Tools](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/AsyncTools) for giving me a starting
point.

## Usage
1. Change paths in `ap-async.bat` to match your AP install (PLAYERS and WORLDS)
1. Create a configuration YAML with your desired settings and number of games
(see `games/async.yaml` for example)
1. Run `gen-async.bat` to generate the AP yaml files for the async, then
`ap-async.bat` to generate the worlds in your AP "output" directory
(Alternatively, run `gen-async.bat; ap-async.bat` to do both at once)

### Final Fantasy
1. Generate an equal number of seeds on ffrandomizer.com matching the requested
number set in yaml
1. Put files from ffrandomizer.com (.nes and .yaml) in 
`C:\Games\Randomizers\Final Fantasy Randomizer\Mission Archipelago` (this is
currently hardcoded)
1. Replace `FFR` in .nes filename with username from `.yaml` (so they match exactly)
1. Generate as normal (see Usage above)
1. Copy FFR .nes file to output directory and play this with NES connector (no AP file)

## Notes
- USING WEIGHTS IS CURRENTLY BROKEN - ONLY USE OPTION 1 (COUNTS)

- When using weights, Archipelago guarantees every game gets at least one seed,
even if the weight is 0 or the requested player count is lower than the number
of possible players

## YAML Changes Under Consideration

### DOOM 1993 / DOOM II
- Find a more interesting way to do only boss levels: Unlock all non boss levels
(plus keys) from the start? Make boss level unlocks local so they need to be
found within the game itself? Ensure boss level items are junk so they aren't
part of a larger chain (and especially don't hide guns)?
- Start with all levels, or start with all keys: See if either of these options
remain interesting while being slightly less frustratingly slow to unlock

### Ocarina of Time
- When the bridge requires one medallion or one stone, ensure that the opposite
type is given: Is this even possible? There are options for nonlocal
rewards/medallions/stones but I dunno what that does since you can't shuffle
them in this version
- Start with bunny hood if Complete Mask Quest is true: doesn't seem possible
until we get the new version of OoTR that has starting with Zelda's Letter

### Subnautica
- Make it more closed for longer: Not sure how to fix this, but particularly at
higher difficulty depths, the game opens up the entire overworld map (and some
of the underworld) as soon as you find the local seaglide pieces

## TODO - BUGS
- fails in weights mode because weights.yaml isn't set up correctly

## TODO - FEATURES
- add weighted chance option to select random games similar to weighted options
  (instead of count)
- update every YAML to include target AP World version
- set progression_balancing in configuration YAML for easier switching (this can
be in meta.yaml for weights, but must be done manually for counts)
- separate async.yaml (settings) from game-weights.yaml (game weights - won't
need top level "game" key anymore)
- verify minimum versions in game yamls
- update ap-gen.bat to default to 1 multiworld if just press enter (blank)
- don't generate weights.yaml in count mode
- update ap-gen.bat to use weights if weights.yaml exists, count otherwise
- override switches in generate such as --mode weights, --mode count, --max-rank 3
- output final data table as csv (possible --csv option)
- fix categorize: rank, max rank, and rank mult (will require determining and
retaining rank for each game, instead of flattening the directory structure and
ignoring it)
- detect number of games generated from AP output when using weight mode and
print a summary at the end
- setup script or on a first run of gen-async.bat asking for path to AP install
so gen-async.bat doesn't require manual modification (and some mechanics to
reset to change)

## Check Counts
- Symphony of the Night:
  - base: guarded	37 / eq 102 / full 386
  - bosses	+13
  - enemies	+141
